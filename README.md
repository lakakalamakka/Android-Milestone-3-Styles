# Android-Milestone-3-Styles
CSS Stylesheet I made which looks like the UI design of earlier versions of Android (specifically Milestone 3 Release Candidate 20 A, a.k.a. Bender)

When using please credit me :D

Pros of using this:
- Styles were accurately created gradient segment-by-segment using real Bender 9-slice images from `framework-res.apk`
- Examples:
  1. ![Button](images/button.png)
  2. ![Textbox](images/textbox.png)
  3. ![Checkbox](images/checkbox.png)
- Aesthetically pleasing
